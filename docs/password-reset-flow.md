# Password Reset Flow Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive password reset functionality implemented for email-based user accounts in the Movie App.

## Overview

The password reset flow allows users who have forgotten their password to securely reset it using their email address. This implementation follows security best practices and provides a smooth user experience.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Email-based password reset**: Users can request a password reset link via email
- **Secure token verification**: Reset links contain secure tokens that expire after 24 hours
- **Password validation**: Strong password requirements with real-time strength indication
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- **Success feedback**: Clear success messages and automatic redirection

### ✅ Security Features
- **Token expiration**: Reset tokens automatically expire after 24 hours
- **Single-use tokens**: Tokens are invalidated after successful password reset
- **Password strength requirements**: Enforced password complexity rules
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in Supabase rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Secure redirects**: Proper validation of redirect URLs

### ✅ User Experience
- **Intuitive flow**: Step-by-step process with clear instructions
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during all operations
- **Error recovery**: Clear error messages with recovery options
- **Mobile responsive**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced AuthService Methods

#### `sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string)`
- Sends password reset email using Supabase Auth
- Includes proper redirect URL to the reset password page
- Returns error handling for invalid emails or system issues

#### `updatePassword(newPassword: string)`
- Updates user password after token verification
- Validates password strength requirements
- Returns user object on success

#### `verifyPasswordResetToken()`
- Verifies if the current session contains a valid reset token
- Checks token expiration and validity
- Returns boolean indicating token status

### 2. Components

#### `ForgotPasswordForm`
- **Location**: `/src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles email input and reset request
- **Features**:
  - Email validation with real-time feedback
  - Loading states during submission
  - Success state with clear instructions
  - Option to resend email or return to login

#### `ResetPasswordForm`
- **Location**: `/src/components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles new password input and update
- **Features**:
  - Token verification on component mount
  - Password strength indicator with 5-level scale
  - Password confirmation validation
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Success state with automatic redirect

### 3. Pages

#### Forgot Password Page
- **Route**: `/auth/forgot-password`
- **Purpose**: Entry point for password reset flow
- **Features**: Simple container for `ForgotPasswordForm`

#### Reset Password Page
- **Route**: `/auth/reset-password`
- **Purpose**: Password update interface accessed via email link
- **Features**: 
  - Token verification
  - Automatic redirect for invalid tokens
  - Integration with auth context

### 4. Routing and Middleware

#### URL Structure
```
/auth/forgot-password     - Request reset email
/auth/reset-password      - Reset password with token
/auth/login              - Login page (with forgot password link)
```

#### Middleware Updates
- Added password reset routes to allowed auth routes
- Prevents redirect loops during reset flow
- Maintains session state during password update

### 5. Email Configuration

#### Supabase Email Template
The system uses Supabase's built-in email templates with the following configuration:
- **Subject**: "Reset your password"
- **Redirect URL**: `${SITE_URL}/auth/reset-password`
- **Token expiration**: 24 hours (configurable in Supabase dashboard)

## Security Considerations

### 1. Token Security
- **Secure generation**: Tokens are generated by Supabase using cryptographically secure methods
- **Limited lifetime**: 24-hour expiration prevents indefinite token validity
- **Single use**: Tokens are invalidated after successful password reset
- **Tamper-proof**: Tokens are cryptographically signed and verified

### 2. Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Supabase provides built-in rate limiting for password reset requests
- Prevents brute force attacks and spam
- Configurable in Supabase dashboard

### 4. Email Security
- Reset emails only sent to verified email addresses
- No sensitive information included in reset emails
- Clear instructions and warnings about password security

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **ForgotPasswordForm**: Tests email validation, submission, error handling, and success states
- **ResetPasswordForm**: Tests token verification, password validation, and update process
- **AuthService**: Tests all password reset methods with various scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end password reset flow
- Token expiration handling
- Error recovery scenarios
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Forgot Password**:
   - Go to login page
   - Click "Forgot your password?" link
   - Enter your email address
   - Click "Send reset link"
   - Check your email for the reset link

2. **Reset Password**:
   - Click the link in your email
   - Enter your new password (following strength requirements)
   - Confirm your new password
   - Click "Update password"
   - You'll be automatically signed in and redirected

### For Developers

1. **Enable in Supabase**:
   - Ensure email auth is enabled
   - Configure email templates if needed
   - Set appropriate rate limits

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=your_site_url
   ```

3. **Customization**:
   - Password requirements can be modified in validation functions
   - Email templates can be customized in Supabase dashboard
   - UI components can be styled to match your design system

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
1. **Invalid email**: Clear validation message
2. **User not found**: Generic message to prevent user enumeration
3. **Expired token**: Redirect to request new reset link
4. **Network errors**: Retry options with clear messaging
5. **Weak password**: Real-time feedback with improvement suggestions

### Error Recovery
- All error states provide clear next steps
- Users can easily retry operations
- Fallback options (e.g., contact support) for persistent issues

## Future Enhancements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reset email not received**:
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check Supabase email delivery logs

2. **Reset link doesn't work**:
   - Check if link has expired (24 hours)
   - Ensure link is complete (check for line breaks)
   - Try requesting a new reset link

3. **Password requirements too strict**:
   - Review password requirements
   - Provide clear guidance on requirements
   - Consider adjusting requirements if appropriate

4. **Redirect issues**:
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set correctly
   - Check middleware configuration
   - Ensure routes are properly configured

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser developer tools for console errors
2. Verify network requests in network tab
3. Check Supabase Auth logs in dashboard
4. Test with different browsers and devices
5. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

This password reset implementation provides a secure, user-friendly way for users to recover their accounts while maintaining the highest security standards.
